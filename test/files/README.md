All the file that resides in this folder and beyond is property of respective owner.

As a purpose of testing chart format that is designed to be portable among Malody library itself. None of those are allowed to be uploaded to ANY Malody Chart Server, unless it's the owner of the chart itself who uploads it.

Failing to comply may result in takedown request due to stealing of property to the respective servers.

Chart Mirroring is ok, but claiming it as yours is a no. However, for all charts labeled by Rei_Fan49, or me; **strictly not allowed to be mirrored by anyone else, unless I gave the permission explicitly.** Mirroring the chart due to forking is not breaking the rules as it's intended to be testing materials.

This does not mean any possible transformation into other chart format is allowed as well, that's still part of transforming someone's work into other format that yielding similar/exact experience towards the player.
