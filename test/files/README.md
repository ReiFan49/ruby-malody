As a purpose of testing chart format that is designed to be portable among Malody library itself. None of those are allowed to be uploaded to ANY Malody Chart Server, unless it's the owner of the chart itself who uploads it.

Failing to comply may result in takedown request due to stealing of property to the respective servers.

Chart Mirroring is ok, but claiming it as yours is a no.
